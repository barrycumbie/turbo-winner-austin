## Hobbies/Interests
When I have free time I enjoy going to the gym :boxing_glove: , racing dirtbikes :bike: , and walking my dog :dog2:. I enjoy going to the gym and working out almost daily. My favorite muscle group to work is back/biceps :muscle:. I also race dirtbikes in my free time. I currently have a 2019 Honda CRF250RX that I race in a series called **SECCA**. Lastly, I love walking my German Shepard. My dogs name is Barkley and he is 2 years old. He is very sweet but seems to always have unlimited energy.
