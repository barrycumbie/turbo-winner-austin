# Austin's Food App

narrative/the problem

I eat food almsot everyday as most people do. The age long question I always see to ask myself is "What do i want to eat?".
I am hungry almost every 3-4 hours during my active day. It is so hard to sit there and figure out exactly what I want to eat that particular moment. This app is supposed to help users(me) pick what foods I may want to eat. I sometimes get brain fog when trying to think of a certain food but this app will show a type of food and allow me to choose from the options. 

user story / wireframe

As someone who enjoys food but doesnt know what exactly I want to eat
I want to know what food I should eat so that I can spend less time 
deciding and more time feasting.
